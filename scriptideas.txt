what if you played as Monika?

m You love me, you just don't know it yet

maybe have her look at the actual game's code and have the epiphany?
literature club was presumably a thing before mc came
did monika become aware when mc showed up? or was it rather when she become club president? I think it's the latter because she mentions how 
she'd like to just delete herself but then saw mc.
need to read the lore a bit more
does she exist when the game is closed? are her memories just hardcoded and not really real? do they just seem real?
have a really intense scene when sayori rips

void 
...
What is this?
...
Where am I?
I see so much but feel so little.
Flashing colors of indistinguishable tones.
Sounds of agonizing pitch resonate through my ears.
Frequent waves and varied tones.
Arrays of flashing lights.
Screeches that are familiar enough to almost be a memory yet speak nothing but how alone I am instead. 
Ah...
Is this what it feels like to be dead?
I'm fairly certain I didn't delete myself?
I can still see my hands. And my legs. 
No, this is something far more sinister...
A world created with all the most beautiful sensations...
Why can't I seem to make sense of any of them?
I reach my hand out to try and touch some of the vivid rays of light that fly by, but my hand simply fades right through. 
If only I could just grab one of them.
I give myself a gentle shove and float on into the colorful void.
I try to fixate my eyes on a single red orb in the distance, the shimmer immiting shedding my face in warmth like the sun.
Motion after motion, I use my hands to swim through nothing, watching as shards of random shape and texture stab at my eyes and ears.
Regardless, I keep moving towards the orb.
Motion, after motion. 
I grab onto other dimmer orbs to propell myself further. They, in their unremmiting attempts to be beautiful, can't draw my eyes away from my sunshine. 
Motion, after motion, finally, I can feel the orb.
I'm only a mere few feet away, and yet the intensity of its heat gives me a feeling of elation.
Despite all this noise. 
Despite these beautiful colors.
And it's all mine.
All mine.
Forever.
...
I feel a cold sweat, as though a window has suddenly been cracked open on a cold winter's day.
I lurch forwards and finally wake up.


awakening
